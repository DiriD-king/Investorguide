How did Elon Musk get to where he is today at the top of the ladder? I'll tell you how, by investing in Companies, buying shares.

     **How do I get paid**
Now, let's talk about how much you will be earning.
Investing in companies is where the gold is at! You can earn anywhere from *$4000-$1000000* a month and even more! depending on your investing capital, the company and a couple other factors.
When you invest in a company, by buying shares you get paid in interest based on how much the shares you acquired are worth. 
Note: the higher the company's worth, the higher the shares, the higher the interest you get paid.

Some of you may be asking, how do i start?
Well, firstly, I'll advice not to rush things. 
- Choose a company you would like to invest in
- Research the company,their financial stats and prospects
- Also find out when their shares would be available to the public
- Investment is all about risk, so invest with the highest you are willing to risk (dont forget the higher your investment, the higher the risk and outcome)
- And importantly, you should be well vested with adequate knowledge of the necessary laws regarding acquisition company shares in your country
